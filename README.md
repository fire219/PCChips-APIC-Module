### Make your M720 slightly less useless!

The [PCChips M720](https://theretroweb.com/motherboards/s/pcchips-m720) is a dual [Slot 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_1) motherboard that doesn't necessarily run dual CPUs.

In all their cost-cutting wisdom, a needed component was left off the board -- the Intel 82093AA [APIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller), which handles interrupt routing between multiple processors. Instead, they added a card slot for a module that houses the APIC. Without it, the M720 is just an incredibly mediocre Slot 1 motherboard. And in the modern day, most of the examples you find for sale don't have the module included.

If you're one of those poor souls to have a module-less M720, here's your chance to fix that.

This is a re-engineered module that should fit in the existing slot, with a few changes made to make it easier to hand-solder together. All that you need is:

* This PCB ([JLCPCB can fab it for cheap](https://jlcpcb.com/))
* The S82093AA APIC (check eBay or Aliexpress)
* 4x 4.7kÎ© resistors (1206 size)
* 4x 100nF capacitors (1206 size)
